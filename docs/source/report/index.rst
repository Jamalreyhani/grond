Report
======

Grond's reports are presented in interactive HTML webpages where you can browse and compare different events and inversion runs.

    **Figure 1**: Example of a Grond report, here the bootstrapped misfit evolution of a static inversion is shown. Use the left navigation panel to navigate the plots.

Generate reports
----------------

When an inversion is finished and with a set-up project structure you can create and open the report with:

.. code-block:: sh
    
    grond report -so <rundir>

The flags ``-s`` will spin up a webserver and ``-o`` will open the browser; more information is given from ``grond report --help``.


Plot types
----------

This section will briefly describe the plots which are generated by the different modules (e.g. :class:`~grond.targets.waveform.WaveformTarget` or :class:`~grond.optimiser.HighScoreOptimiser`). If a module was not configured for the run, it will not generate any plots.

To see which plots are available, check out the subcommand``grond plot list <rundir>``. We however recommend using the above ``report`` subcommand.
