Overview
========

Grond can be run as a command line tool or by calling its library functions
from a Python script.

The command line tool offers several subcommands. To find out what subcommands
are available, run ::
   
	grond --help 

To get more information about any of the available subcommands and its options,
try ::

	grond <subcommand> --help

The basic work-flow when using Grond is as follows:

* Set up a project folder containing input data and Green's functions.
* Set up a configuration file for Grond.
* Check the set-up with the  ``grond check`` subcommand.
* Run the optimiser/inversion using the ``grond go`` subcommand.
* Generate a report and plot results with ``grond report``.

Some details on these steps are given in the following sections.

Project folder layout
---------------------

To use Grond with your data and the medium model of your choice, we suggest the
following folder structure. Single files listed here are explained below.

Input data
----------

TODO: intro sentence

**Seismic waveform data**

Required input files are:

* raw waveform data (Mini-SEED format or other formats supported by `Pyrocko`_)
* instrument response information (StationXML format)

Various tools exists to download raw waveforms and instrument response
information from `FDSN web services`_ (`here is a basic Python script example
<https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/library/examples/fdsn_download.html>`_).
Grond can use continuous data (recommended) as well as event-based cut-outs. If
event-based data is used, make sure that the time windows are long enough.
Generously enlarge the window before and after the signal to be analysed. Add
at least 5 times the longest period to be analysed to both sides. Add more if
pre-event noise should be analysed for data-weighting.


**InSAR data**

For preparing and incorporating InSAR data see the `Kite`_ documentation.
`Kite`_ is an interactive tool for inspection and transport of static
displacement maps. It can be used for data noise estimations, easy quadtree
data sub-sampling and calculation of data error variance-covariance matrices
for proper data weighting. 

Required input files are ``kite_scene.yml`` and ``kite_scene.npz`` which can be
generated by `Kite`_.


**GNSS data**

Required input file is a simple `YAML`_ file containing GNSS station positions,
displacement values and measurement uncertainties (example :download:`gnss.yaml
<../files/gnss.yaml>`). 

TODO: Link to Pyrocko GNSS docs

Green's functions
-----------------

A Pyrocko Green's function (GF) store is needed that stores GFs for many
possible source-receiver configurations. You can either download from the
online repository (`online GF databases`_) or compute them with the `fomosto`_
module of `Pyrocko`_. Depending on the application, different set-ups of GF
stores or methods for calculation are suitable:

.. _fomosto: https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/fomosto/index.html


**GFs for global teleseismic waveform data**

For the point-source analysis of large global earthquakes, a global GF store
with a sampling frequency of 0.5 Hz may suffice. Such a store can be downloaded
with Fomosto, using

::

    fomosto download kinherd global_2s store 

**GFs for regional and local seismic waveform data**

Regional analyses may require region-specific GF stores. Given a suitable
1D-layered velocity model, GF stores can be built with the `Fomosto QSEIS
backend`_.

**GFs for near-field static displacement data (InSAR, GNSS)**

Near-field static displacements require GF stores with high spatial sampling
and mostly only little temporal sampling. With the `Fomosto PSGRN/PSCMP
backend`_, you can build your on GF store for any given local 1D-layered
velocity model.

Configuration
-------------

TODO: shorten config file example, describe overall structure

You can create an initial Grond configuration file for a centroid moment tensor
optimization based on global seismic waveforms with

.. code-block :: sh

    grond init > config/cmt.gronf
    
Identically, for static near-field displacement (InSAR, GNSS data sets) and
finite source optimisation set-ups, initial Grond configuration file can be
created with

.. code-block :: sh

    grond init --waveforms > config/.gronf
    grond init --insar > <project>.gronf
    grond init --gnss --insar > <project>.gronf   
 
The ``targets`` (data and misfit setups for seimsic waveforms, InSAR and or GNSS data) can be combined and sources types can be exchanged. A Grond configuration file showing all possible options with their default values is given using: 

.. code-block :: sh

    grond init --full > <project>.gronf`

Commented snippets of Grond configuration files explaining all options can be found here for 

**Example configurations**

* point-source optimizations based on waveforms: :download:`config_example_waveforms.yaml </../../examples/config_example_waveforms.yaml>`
* finite source optimizations based on InSAR data: :download:`config_example_static.yaml </../../examples/config_example_static.yaml>`
    

**Configuration file structure**
    
.. literalinclude :: /../../examples/config_example_static.yaml
    :language: yaml


Optimisation
------------

You may want to check your dataset and configuration file (see suggestions above) and debug
it if needed with the command:

::

	grond check <configfile> <eventname>

Now, you may start the optimization for a given event using:

::
	
	grond go <configfile> <eventname>

During the optimization, results are aggregated in an output directory, referred to `<rundir>`  in the configuration. 

You find detailed information on the misfit configuration and model space 
sampling in the Chapter `Optimisers`_.


Results and visualisation
-------------------------

To visualize the results check your plot options with

::

	grond plot list <rundir> 

For more information on the prepared result plots see `grond plot details`_.


The results can be exported in various ways by running the subcommand:

::

	grond export <what> <rundir>

Finally, you may run:

::
	
	grond report <rundir>
	grond report-index reports 

to aggregate all results to a browsable summary, (by default) under the directory `reports`. 
Please find detailed information on the plots in the Chapter `Result Plots`_.
