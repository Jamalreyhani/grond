Targets
=======

TODO: describe the different target types available in Grond, and when to use
what. Special things like alignment with picks, cross correlation based fitting
log amp spec fitting, overall amplitude fitting, envelope fitting, etc can be
described here (with examples). Technical details should go to the library
reference.
