Grond
=====

A probabilistic earthquake source inversion framework. Designed and crafted in Mordor.

Introduction
------------

Grond is a software tool and framework for robust characterization of
earthquake sources from diverse observations. It employs efficient forward
modeling as well as elaborate inversion strategies and delivers meaningful
model uncertainties.

The software implements a Bayesian bootstrap-based probabilistic inversion
scheme for heterogeneous data. It explores the full model space and helps
mapping potential model parameter trade-offs. The program is highly flexible
with respect to the adoption to specific problems, the design of objective
function, and the diversity of measurements.

Our modelling approach is based on pre-computed Green's function databases,
which provide synthetic near-field geodetic data (InSAR, GNSS and gravity)
together with synthetic seismic waveforms at all distances and receiver depths.
